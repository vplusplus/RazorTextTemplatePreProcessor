//	 Razor Text Template Pre-Processor (Custom tool name: RTT)
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provides a custom tool that can pre-process text templates using Razor syntax 
to self-contained and stand-alone text generation template 
with NO MVC dependency. 

If you are looking for pre-compiling standard MVC Razor Views, 
you are using a wrong custom tool. The class generated by this custom tool 
is conceptually comparable to T4 templates.

Base class

Generated class depends on a base class that provides required signatures. 
The custom-tool has two stock implementation of the baseclasses,
one for TextTemplate and another for HtmlTemplate.

The TextTemplate base class provides minimal signatures required for 
Razor syntax based text generation. 

The HtmlTemplate provides additional services like 
Nested layouts, NamedSections, etc. which are typical of html generation.

You can grab the default implementation of the base-class using following steps:
1) Create an empty file named TextTemplate.cshtml or HtmlTemplate.cshtml
2) Set Custom Tool name and generate

The generated base-class can be left-alone as-is in the assembly (self-contained-model) 
or can be moved aside to a shared library.  

If you customize the base class, to use the custom base-class for other templates:
a) Update the nearest web config or
b) Use standard @inherits Razor directive
